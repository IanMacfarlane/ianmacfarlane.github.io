		eulogyTextElement.innerHTML = "<b>Eulogy for LaRue Macfarlane By Virginia Macfarlane Thorley Olds</b> Aunt LaRue was such a cute little individual and I thoroughly enjoyed my association with her especially in these last few years as we visited. Her mind was alert and she never lost her sense of humor. [As I would visit with Aunt LaRue we would have such an enjoyable time. In those last few years her mind was alert and she never lost her sense of humor. As we visited in later years several times she mentioned that she would like me to speak at her funeral.] I am thankful for the opportunity the family has given me to express my love and appreciation for their sweet kind mother, LaRue Macfarlane. Aunt LaRue\’s life can be summed up in one word -service-. As was stated in her patriarchal blessing. \“Thy life shall be spared and be a blessing unto many both old and young both friends and strangers. Thy teachings will bear fruit that will gladden thy heart all thy days. Therefore, keep thyself in preparation for service, acknowledging the hand of the Lord in his kindness unto thee and thou shalt be blessed in body and in mind and be preserved in health, in virtue and in honor.\” Larue Quayle Macfarlane was born the second child of John Freeman Quayle and Margaret Ellen Hunter Quayle having his sister Kathleen, two years older and a brother John William 14 years younger. Her home for the first five years of life was on the Montpelier Canyon Road near the gristmill there w[h]ere her father worked milling wheat. When she was about five her father bought a wheat farm south of Montpelier and they moved down the Canyon Road to another home. She attended Washington Elementary School. And as a young girl she was a little mischievous. At recess she liked to wade in the ditch in her shoes and socks and then had to sit in school the rest of the day, all wet. One day, desiring to leave school early she and some friends help the old wood stove smoke up the classroom so that the class was excused to go home early. In her youth she helped with farm work, she would feed the chickens and then gather the eggs and sell them at the store in town. She loved to ride horses and always helped on the farm. She helped her father homestead a piece of property by staying on the property living in a sheep wagon by herself for a month. After graduating from Montpelier High School, her first job was a dry goods store, which lasted only two months. Her next job was working part-time at the telephone company. She worked in the evening from 6 to 10 PM and as a bookkeeper for the farmers equity company. During the day until she got permanent employment with the telephone company. She worked for the telephone company for three years, two as an operator and one year as assistant chief operator. It was during this time that LaRue and three other girls in the office decided they didn’t want to just say \“number please\” all their lives. One of the girls in the office had osteomyelitis in her foot and discussed with the other girls what a noble career nursing was. This helped LaRue and three other girls in the office decide to go into nursing. LaRue saved her money and in January, 1924, at the age of 21, she entered nurses training at LDS hospital in Salt Lake City. After only being in nurses training for six months. LaRue\’s mother passed away, June 24, 1924 in Idaho. She took a six week leave of absence to go home to help. Returning to school she finished her training on February 10, 1927, but had to wait to graduate and help in May 1927 and take her state board examination in June. LaRue had made a friend in training, LaRue Clark, from St. George, Utah. She talked her into going down to Cedar City, Utah to work at the Iron County Hospital where LaRue Clark\’s uncle Dr.Macfarlane lived. LaRue joined the nursing staff at the Iron County Hospital in Cedar City June 5, 1927. Along with her hospital work LaRue met and dated several young man but her favorite was Clair Macfarlane. During their courting Clair and LaRue, Wallace and Guenever and Clair\’s and Wallace\’s mother drove to Salt Lake to visit their sister Vera. On the way back they had car trouble so LaRue called the hospital in Cedar to tell them she would be late. Dr. Mac and the nurses at the hospital decided they would like to play a prank on them, so they got into their cars and went out to meet Clair and LaRue, when they met them, they tied tin cans on the back of Claire\’s and LaRue\’s car and chevareed them all the way back to Cedar City. About this time Clair and LaRue became engaged and Clair was ready to get married, but LaRue had already promised a friend that she would go to California with her and work in a hospital there. After LaRue had been in California for about a month she called up Clair and said, \“bring your mother and your best suit and meet me in St. George and we will get married\”. He did and they were married. Aunt LaRue came into my life right after I was born. My mother was very ill and Aunt LaRue and Uncle Clair took her into their home where Aunt LaRue took care of my mother until her death two and ½ months later. I have been very grateful to her for her loving tender care to my mother. I was then raised by Aunt Bell Armstrong but was not forgotten by my mother\’s family, Clair, Wallace and Chauncey, and their wives, and Vera and Uncle Howard. I remember very nearly every Saturday Aunt Bell would send me down to Beiderman\’s Meat Market where Uncle Clair worked, with $0.25 to buy a little meat for Sunday but I always came home with what I know now it was much more than $0.25 worth of meat. I remember every fall Uncle Clair would butcher our pig for us and make that delicious sausage. Every fall Aunt LaRue would come over with a little dress she wanted me to try on. She said she was giving the dress to a little girl about my size and wanted to see how it would look. It took several years before I realized the little dress I tried on in the fall was the same dress I got for Christmas. I was still living with Aunt Belle when she was very ill with cancer and needed surgery. Aunt LaRue and Uncle Clair took me to live with them for a few days. I was so excited because I thought they had such a lovely home and I was also excited to be with Richard and Margielee. It was here I learned the greatest lesson Aunt LaRue could teach me and that was her faith in prayer. I slept in a bed with Aunt LaRue and one night I awoke to see Aunt LaRue down on her knees praying to her father in heaven to bless and help Aunt Bell. Now, this had a great impact on me as a child because I knew Aunt Bell said her prayers and I had been taught to pray but I didn’t know other adults said personal prayers until I saw Aunt LaRue. I would like the grandchildren to know that your grandmother had great faith in her heavenly father and in the power of prayer and she prayed all her life for guidance from her Heavenly Father. She taught Richard and Margielee the importance of prayer in their lives, also concerning prayer. Aunt LaRue told the story as a girl of 17 she almost lost her life while helping her father clear land. She was riding on one of the horses of a team pulling a harrow to drag tumbleweeds as tall as a man. One of the horses in the team was spooked, bolted and tried to break loose. In the struggle the cinch on her saddle loosened, her saddle slid to the side of the horse between the team causing her to fall off the horse between the team and then under the harrow. Luckily the harrow teeth were turned to the back. She was dragged quite a ways but she recalled how fervently she prayed that she would be protected and her life spared, and her prayer was answered. However, she did receive several bruises, cuts and scrapes and wore a large scar on her back the rest of her life where one of the harrow teeth had dug in. The only medication they had on the farm to help was mentholatum which they put on cuts. She also related the story of when she was working at the hospital and was the only nurse on duty as nearly everyone in town had gone to the arena downtown where a boxing match was being held. Aunt LaRue was taking care of a woman in labor and a man who had pierced his foot with a pitchfork. At this time a man who had fallen off a horse was brought into the hospital. He was exhibiting very violent behavior and it was all she and the man with the hurt foot could do to control him. She was very frightened and as she prayed for help the situation was brought under control. Prayer was her comfort throughout her life and she had a firm testimony of the power of prayer. After 40 years Aunt LaRue retired from the hospital where she had served as superintendent of nurses, business manager, x-ray technician and as an anesthetist. At the time of her retirement in 1967 Dan Valentine wrote in the Salt Lake Tribune. A dedicated nurse is just about the most valuable citizen a community can have and today\’s Valentine goes to a truly dedicated nurse LaRue Quayle Macfarlane. A registered nurse for 40 years (graduate of LDS Hospital), Mrs. Macfarlane has retired. But her memory lingers on. For years nurse Macfarlane was on call night and day in Iron County. She lives in Cedar City, and has helped hundred and hundreds of people back to health again as a nurse at Iron County Hospital and Valley View Medical Center. A wonderful nurse, a splendid woman, a fine citizen and her birthday is Thursday, April 6. A Valentine to you, nurse Macfarlane. As I said, Aunt LaRue’s life was a life of service to those with whom she served in the hospital and her friends and family. She made trips every day to help her friend down the street. She took my mother into her home to nurse and care for her. She cared for her mother-in-law until her death. She brought her own father into her home for care. And she made many trips to Aunt Bell\’s to bath and give her shots when she was dying from cancer. And I\’m sure Aunt LaRue cared for many others that we are not aware of. Perhaps the greatest service Aunt LaRue performed was caring for her own dear husband. She gave up all her outside interests so that she could be with Uncle Clair night and day. She was always by his side and as the months went on and became bedridden she spent the entire day caring for him. She made sure he was always clean and the bed was clean and he was as comfortable as possible. She worked so hard finding foods he could swallow. And even though he didn\’t recognize her and couldn\’t speak, she continued to lovingly take care of him. When Uncle Clair was so ill I would go sometimes to maybe cheer Aunt LaRue up but I was always the one who came away feeling good. Yes, LaRue Macfarlane was a grand lady and she certainly lived up to the promise given in her patriarchal blessing given in 1924. \“Many will also look to thee with blessings upon thy head because of thy deeds of kindness because of thy works of true charity. Thou shalt stand, as it were, an angel of mercy in the midst of those who are in need\”. May the Lord bless and comfort Richard, Sarah, Margielee and the grandchildren with great memories of a wonderful mother and grandmother. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.";

		joannMemoriesTextElement.innerHTML = "<b>Memories of Great Grandma Macfarlane by JoAnn</b> My memories go back to my early elementary school years. I remember looking forward to birthdays and Christmas because Grandma would send store bought clothes. She would really put time and effort into picking them out. Those outfits were the only store bought clothes I really ever had, and I loved them. In all of my early elementary school pictures I was wearing one of those outfits. They were always some type of a dress or a top with a skirt because in those early school days girls weren’t allowed to wear pants to school. Grandpa and Grandma Macfarlane came to visit our family in Chester. They drove their white Pontiac Bonneville car. That car was the fanciest vehicle that I had ever seen or had the chance to ride in. Grandma took meticulous care of their car and house, so to be able to ride in it you needed to be on your very best behavior. I remember them taking me for a ride up to Ted’s Store and asking me if I wanted to buy some candy. On their way to Chester, they had stopped in at the Big Rock Candy Mountain which is close to Marysville, Utah and bought the grandkids toy rubber donkeys that had an air ball attached to them and when you squeezed it the donkey would buck. We had fun playing with the donkeys. During summer breaks when I was in elementary school, I was able to go to Cedar City and stay with Grandpa and Grandma Macfarlane for a few days in the summers. It was always a real treat to go and stay with them. They would both roll out the red carpet especially Grandma. I always loved their house and backyard. As stated before Grandma was a meticulous house keeper. The house was white with a steep red shingled roof. It had a rounded front door with a small window to look out to see who was knocking. It had a sunken living room and a bay window in the dining room. The guest bedroom had a door that went out to the backyard. Their backyard was like a magicial forest with large pine trees, grass, and flower. I remember them having a plastic deer and fawn in the yard to really make it look like a forest. The smell of wintergreen lifesavers and double mint gum could be smelled on Grandpa and in their kitchen where they kept the supply of gum and mints in a cabinet. Grandma and I would always take a shopping trip to Woolworths which was a child’s delight. I remember especially liking the animal and critter section of the store. They had miniature frogs and turtles. I don’t remember getting any, but I liked looking at them and wishing that I could. I did one time get some Mexican jumping beans in a little plastic case. At the store they were jumping all over the place, but when we got home they stopped jumping. With them not jumping they really lost their allure, so Grandma and I took them back for a refund. I would help feed Sam their dog and then go on a ride with Grandpa in his white International truck out to his farm to see his horse Sheree. Sheree was more a of pet to Grandpa. He had given her treats of candy corns and she had gotten spoiled. One day she bit Grandpa on the upper arm. I wasn’t there when this happened, but I remember being shown the large bruise that she had left. After that I was to keep my distance from Sheree. She now had a bad reputation. Grandma would have me sleep with her so I wouldn’t be afraid when being away from home. She would sing me the song \“School days, School days dear old golden rule days. Reading and writing and arithmetic. Talk to the tune of the hickory stick.\” This is only part of the song, but I still remember the whole song to this day. I really enjoyed my summer trips to visit Grandpa and Grandma Macfarlane. In junior high and high school things kind of changed because Grandpa Macfarlane started to lose his memory and had other health issues. Grandma became his fulltime nurse which she was very capable of doing. She gave him the very best care, but it wasn’t easy for her in anyway. Because of her excellent nursing skills, Grandpa lasted in a bedridden state for a few years. I remember many Sundays driving with Dad to Cedar City to spend the day with Grandpa and Grandma. Grandma would want to talked to Dad in private, so she would ask me to go and sit with Grandpa and hold his hand. I remember the tender care that she gave him and how tears would come to his eyes and she would lovely kiss him and wipe the tears away. Grandpa passed away when I was junior or senior is high school. My relationship continued with Grandma Macfarlane when I went to college at SUU in Cedar City. I would go once a week to spend the day with her. It always started with just visiting telling her what had happened during the week. She always liked to hear about the fun lite hearted things that were going on. I enjoyed making her laugh. After our visit, she would outline me with a few things that I could help her with. I would mop the kitchen floor, wash windows, fill the bucks with coal for her furnace, and do yard work. There were two yards projects that stand out in my mind. One was trimming Grandma’s large pyracantha bush in her front yard. Pyracantha bushes are pretty, but they have wicked thorns on them. I headed out with a log sleeve wool shirt, leather gloves (that the thorns still got through), and an electric hedge trimmer that Grandma had supplied me with. She wanted the bush to be trimmed in a circular shape. I was so nervous that my bush trimming would not met Grandma’s expectations. It took me all day, but somehow it turned out pretty well. I was definitely breathing a sigh of relief. In fact, I felt so good about the job I had done for Grandma Macfarlane that the next week I borrowed all the equipment that I had used and headed to Grandma Jenson\’s house to trim her tall hedge that ran the length of her driveway. In the end I was pretty happy with both Grandma\’s trimming projects. The second yard project I didn\’t feel so great about. Grandma had me take the fertilizer spreader and cast nitrogen all over the front yard grass. Easy job no problems. A week or so later I was back at Grandma’s house and saw all these round orange rust spots all over her front sidewalk. Long story short I should have swept the nitrogen off the sidewalk before it was watered in. Grandma never said anything to me, but I have felt bad about that for years. Remember Grandma Macfarlane was meticulous. Grandma would have me take her big white Bonneville car out for some exercise (she wasn\’t driving as much and didn\’t want the battery to go dead). I had to get use to backing it out of her driveway which I considered steep and narrow. She might ask me to get a few things from the store and then I was to drive it around. I did a fair amount dragging Main Street in Cedar City. It was still a very nice car, but probably not my first choice of vehicles to drag Main in. The car had lost some of its appeal from when I was much younger. Grandma would always remind me not to park by two door vehicles because she said the doors were longer and she didn\’t want her car dented or scratched. The next part of the day would be would be having lunch together. She would either make lunch using her pressure cooker or we might go out on the town and have lunch at McDonalds. I always knew when it was going to be McDonalds because Grandma would be dressed up ready to go. Lunch always needed to be at a certain time because we would then watch the soap box opera \“As the World Turns.\” Grandma would catch me up with what had happened earlier in the week. I think that Grandma was a romantic at heart. When I got my first teaching job in Salt Lake, Grandma gave me a folding chair and a lamp. She said that when she was first getting started those simple things had really helped her. I used and kept those two items for years. Grandma knew what she was talking about. Grandma Macfarlane lived alone in her own home until she passed way at the age of 90. She enjoyed talking on the phone with her friends and family. Her longtime home teacher and her neighbor/friend Alice from across the street greatly helped her to be able to stay in her own home, as well as her own abilities to take care of herself. Grandma Macfarlane was quite a remarkable lady in many ways. She was an excellent nurse and the bread winner for her family. She was loving and kind always giving a kiss on the cheek and much appreciated gifts on birthdays, Christmas, and when she felt that someone was in need. I love and cherish the memories that I have of Great Grandma Macfarlane.";
